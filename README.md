## Score Rankings

- **80-100%**: Supreme Nepo Baby - Born with a platinum spoon
- **60-79%**: Certified Nepo Baby - Significant advantages
- **40-59%**: Nepo-Adjacent - Some privileges and connections
- **20-39%**: Mostly Self-Made - Worked for most achievements
- **0-19%**: Self-Made - Built everything from scratch

## The "Exodia Effect" 🔥

The quiz includes **6 nuclear "Exodia" questions** that carry extreme weight in the scoring system. These questions identify the most extreme privilege indicators:

1. **Trust Fund / Inheritance** (7-figure+ family wealth)
2. **Family Business Empire** (major corporations or industry leaders)
3. **Celebrity / Political Family** (national/international public figures)
4. **Executive Positions Gifted** (C-suite or board seats through family)
5. **Property Portfolio** (4+ properties or significant real estate holdings)
6. **Financial Safety Net** (indefinite family support with no concerns)

### Tier Floor System

The Exodia Effect implements a **tier floor guarantee**:

- **1 nuclear answer** = Minimum 60% score (Certified Nepo Baby tier floor)
- **2+ nuclear answers** = Minimum 80% score (Supreme Nepo Baby tier floor)

This means if you have a 7-figure trust fund, you **cannot** score below Certified Nepo Baby, regardless of other answers. The system recognizes that certain privilege indicators are so extreme they categorically define your nepotism level.

When the tier floor is activated, your results will display: **"🔥 EXODIA EFFECT ACTIVATED"** with an explanation of the guarantee.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure with inline JavaScript
- **CSS3** - Advanced animations, gradients, glassmorphism, responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** - Dynamic quiz logic, color interpolation, real-time scoring

## Architecture

This project uses an **inline JavaScript architecture** where all quiz logic is embedded directly in `index.html`. This approach:
- ✅ Reduces HTTP requests (faster initial load)
- ✅ Keeps everything in one file for simplicity
- ✅ Perfect for single-page applications
- ✅ No build tools or bundlers required

## Deployment

This project is configured with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Setting Up GitHub Pages

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
3. Under "Build and deployment", select:
   - **Source**: GitHub Actions
4. Push to the `main` branch, and your site will automatically deploy!

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes two automated workflows:

**Deploy Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
- ✅ Runs on every push to main/master
- ✅ Validates HTML and JavaScript
- ✅ Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Provides deployment URL

**PR Checks** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`):
- ✅ Runs on pull requests
- ✅ Validates code quality
- ✅ Checks file structure
- ✅ Warns about console.log statements
